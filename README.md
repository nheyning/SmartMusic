AI generated music with a twist

Since 2022 the following two developments allow for a new innovation called SmartMusic:
1) Smart watches with full biometric registration of temperature, movement, heart rate, and location
2) Generative AI, with unique music and visual generation

By combining these two technologies we can create a dialogue between the music generation and the human experience of it.

Imagine yourself in the near future dancing at a club and everybody is enjoying the party while wearing a smartwatch. The DJ is using AI to realtime generate the music, a unique sound creation of that moment. By listening to all the biodata of the audience, the DJ can feed the AI the instant feedback on its music production  on how people experience it; if the AI generates something the crowd dislikes, the dance movement will calm down as well as the heart rate. If the AI manages to hit the right tone, the opposite will be recorded. Figuring out the ‘human algorithm’ the AI knows how to play the crowd to perfection, building up a show between teasing and climax. The VJ can use the same approach to generate a visual show. 

The dimension and scale of artistry can be changed forever with this new instrument. I imagine that the human DJ will continue to play a crucial role, providing direction or context, but this is to be seen. SmartMusic will remain open-source. In 2024 I aim to develop a prototype and I invite developers and artists to contribute to this project. If you want to get in contact with me, please do.
